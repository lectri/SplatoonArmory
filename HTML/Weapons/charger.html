        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>The charger specializes in long range combat. Don't let your opponents sneak up on you!
            It's difficult to get kills from close up. The sniper has a laser that you and 
            everyone else (including enemies can see. Try to hide your laser before sniping people.<br>
            Also, there are two variants of a sniper, scoped and unscoped. Unscoped has less range with more visibility, and scoped has the opposite.<br>
            You may also hold your charged shot, for a limited amount of time.
