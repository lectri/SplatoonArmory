# SplatoonArmory
A website about Splatoon guns and combat.

# Archive Note
I will stop working on this repo and taking my work to [here.](https://github.com/lectri/splatoon-armory) Managing a project with bare HTML is very tedious so I will be using React to make my life easier. After this commit, I will archive this repo so I can transfer everything from here to there.
